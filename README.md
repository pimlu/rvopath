## RVO avoidance

This is an implementation of [Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles](http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/RVO/icra2008.pdf) for RAMHacks 2017.

It's written in Dart and features reusable vector functions to have cleaner math.  These are automatically inlined by dart2js, so there isn't a performance detriment.

This software is a derivative of the MIT-licensed Angular Dart quickstart, (c) 2017 Google.
